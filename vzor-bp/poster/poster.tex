The subject of this work is the automated machine learning (AutoML), which
is a field that aims to automatize the process of model selection for a given machine
learning problem. We have developed a system that, for a given supervised
learning task represented by a dataset, finds a suitable pipeline --- combination
of machine learning, ensembles and preprocessing methods. For the search we
designed a special instance of the developmental genetic programming which enables
us to encode directed acyclic graph pipelines into a tree representation.
The system is implemented in the Python programming language and operates
on top of the scikit-learn library. The performance of our solution was tested on
72 datasets of the OpenML-CC18 benchmark with very good results.

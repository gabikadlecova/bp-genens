Over the last few years we have witnessed an enormous success of the artificial
intelligence. Thanks to advances in machine learning, a great variety of
applications emerged, ranging from automatized analyses of documents, through
image recognition to music recommendation. The artificial intelligence is already
influencing many parts of our everyday lives.

However, most of these examples rely on fine tuned models developed by large
teams of experts. In addition, a lot of time and resources is necessary. These
factors make the machine learning off-limits to non-experts from unrelated fields
and small teams.

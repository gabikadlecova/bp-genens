The goal of our work was to develop an AutoML system for automatic
pipeline optimization. Using the developmental GP, we created a general encoding
of the scikit-learn pipelines that converts a DAG pipeline into a tree representation.

The encoding was designed in an extensible way. The method search space can be easily 
extended with more ensembles and methods that comply to the scikit-learn API.
We also implemented a tree individual that, compared to the DEAP tree individual, supports
variable arity of nodes.

We introduced several bloat-reducing approaches. The grow method of the GP was
modified to initialize less branched trees, which are more suitable in case of
pipelines. We also employed a weighted node selection, which prefers simpler methods.
As so, we avoided nested ensembles which are computationally demanding, but do not
significantly improve the score.

We also designed several genetic operators used for architecture optimization of the
pipelines as well as for hyperparameter optimization of contained methods.

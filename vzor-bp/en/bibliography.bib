However, current AutoML tools do not yet support modern neural networks effectively. In this work, we present a first version of Auto-Net, which provides automatically-tuned feed-forward neural networks without any human intervention. We report results on datasets from the recent AutoML challenge showing that ensembling Auto-Net with Auto-sklearn often performs better than either alone, and report the first results on winning a competition dataset against human experts with automatically-tuned neural networks.}

abstract="Automated machine learning (AutoML) seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning algorithms, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task (dataset). Although current approaches to AutoML have already produced impressive results, the field is still far from mature, and new techniques are still being developed. In this paper, we present ML-Plan, a new approach to AutoML based on hierarchical planning. To highlight the potential of this approach, we compare ML-Plan to the state-of-the-art frameworks Auto-WEKA, auto-sklearn, and TPOT. In an extensive series of experiments, we show that ML-Plan is highly competitive and often outperforms existing approaches.",

A large dataset (when compared to other studies in this domain) is considered, with white and red vinho verde samples (from Portugal). Three regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs simultaneous variable and model selection. The support vector machine achieved promising results, outperforming the multiple regression and neural network methods. Such model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production. Furthermore, similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets."

The input is a set of Monte Carlo data, generated and approximately triggered and pre-processed for an imaging gamma-ray Cherenkov telescope. Such data belong to two classes, originating either from incident gamma rays or caused by hadronic showers. There is only a weak discrimination between signal (gamma) and background (hadrons), making the data an excellent proving ground for classification techniques. The data and methods are described, and a comparison of the results is made. Several methods give results comparable in quality within small fluctuations, suggesting that they perform at or close to the Bayesian limit of achievable separation. Other methods give clearly inferior or inconclusive results. Some problems that this study can not address are also discussed."
